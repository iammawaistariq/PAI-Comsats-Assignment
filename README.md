## üìå Project Overview

This project implements and evaluates multiple machine learning models for predicting the occurrence of brain strokes using health-related data such as age, gender, BMI, glucose levels, hypertension, heart disease, and more. The goal is to determine which model performs best at identifying high-risk individuals and to compare the results with those published in the paper:

## Two coding files are available
1. Paper Implementation file
2. Our Implementation code file

### Paper Implementation:
The paper has made many mistakes while implementing ML models.
1. Paper applied Ordinal Encoding on all categorical varialbes which does not make sense as most categorical features should be OneHotEncoded.
2. Dataset is highly imbalanced, but paper did not used any class blanacing technique like SMOTE.
3. Results were highly biased and model were overfitted.

## Implement and evaluate the following machine learning models:  
  - KNN (k = 5 and k = 173)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - Naive Bayes
  - SVM (Linear, RBF, Polynomial, Sigmoid kernels)
  - XGBoost

## Assess model performance using metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - F1 Score
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - Log Loss
  - ROC-AUC

- Replicate findings from the referenced paper
- Utilize **MLflow** for tracking experiments and logging metrics

## üìÅ Dataset Description

The dataset is derived from electronic health records (EHR) and consists of 11 features and 1 target variable (`stroke`). The features are:

| Feature           | Description                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `gender`          | Gender of the patient                              |
| `age`             | Age of the patient                                 |
| `hypertension`    | Whether the patient has hypertension               |
| `heart_disease`   | Whether the patient has heart disease              |
| `ever_married`    | Marital status                                     |
| `work_type`       | Job type (Govt_job, Private, Self-employed, etc.) |
| `Residence_type`  | Urban or Rural                                     |
| `avg_glucose_level` | Average glucose level                           |
| `bmi`             | Body Mass Index                                    |
| `smoking_status`  | Smoking status (never, former, current)            |
| `stroke`          | Target variable (1 = stroke, 0 = no stroke)        |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The dataset is highly imbalanced, with far fewer stroke cases than non-stroke cases.
